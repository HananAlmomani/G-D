# Domain modeling 

**Domain modeling** is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

### Define a constructor and initialize properties

*To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.*

|Property   | Data         | Type   |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| epicRating|1 to 10       | Number |
| hasAnimals| true or false| Boolean|

## Tables
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

**< table >**
The < table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.


**< th >**
The < th > element is used just like the < td > element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.) 

**WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS**
*LITERAL NOTATION* 
*OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION*

**STORING DATA**

* VARIABLES
A variable has just one key (the variable name)
and one value.

* ARRAYS
Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.
Each piece of information is separated by a comma.
The order of the values is important because items
in an array are assigned a number (called an index).
Values in an array are put in square brackets,
separated by commas.
