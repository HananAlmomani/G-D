## Old Code: Width & Spacing
The width attribute was used on the opening < table > tag to indicate how wide that table should be and on some opening < th > and < td > tags to specify the width of individual cells. The value of this attribute is the width of the table or cell in pixels.

## Old Code: Border & Background
The border attribute was used on both the < table > and < td > elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.

## Forms
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

## Lists, Tables and Forms
The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also
known as a marker). It can be used on rules that
apply to the < ol> , < ul >, and < li > elements.


## Border on Empty Cells
If you have empty cells in your table, then you can use the empty-cells property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.

## Cursor Styles
The cursor property allows you to control the type of mouse cursor that should be displayed
to users.

## EVENTS
When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling. 

## EVENT LISTENERS
Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events.
They can deal with more than one function at a time
but they are not supported in older browsers.
