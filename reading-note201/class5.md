## IMAGES:

**Choosing Images for Your Site**
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.


**Storing Images on Your Site**
If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.
As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized Here you can see an example of the files for a website; all of the images are stored in a folder called images.

**Adding Images**

< img > To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

* src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site
* alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

## Color
**Foreground Color**
* rgb values:
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
* hex codes:
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: *#ee3e80*
* color names:
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: *DarkCyan*

### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

### **Text**
*Typeface Terminology*

* **Serif**
Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

* **Sans-Serif** 
Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

* **Monospace**
Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.) 

*When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.*

## TL;DR
Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

## Compression
Almost all forms of data that we see on the internet — text, image, video etc. — are compressed to reduce the size of data and ensure faster transmission. Choosing the correct format and compression is a major factor that determines image size.
