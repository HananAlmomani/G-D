## **Lists**

## Ordered Lists :

### <ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element. <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

## **Boxes**

## Box Dimensions

### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

### Limiting Width : Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

### Limiting height : This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

## Border Width
### the border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels.

# WHY USE JQUERY?

## jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

## jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript.

### LOOPING : In plain JavaScript, if you wanted to do the same thing to several elements, you would need to write code to loop through all of the elements you selected. With jQuery, when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to use a loop.
