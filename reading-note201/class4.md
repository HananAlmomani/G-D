# Html:
## Links
### Links are created using the < a > element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute

## Linking to Other Sites
### HTML Links are created using the < a > element which has an attribute called href . The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.

## Layout
### Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

# How does pair programming work?
## While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 

## Why pair program?
### While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful
