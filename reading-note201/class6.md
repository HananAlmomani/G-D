**understanding the problem domain**
if understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

* Make the problem domain easier
* Get better at understanding the problem domain


**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES If a variable is part of an object, it is called a **property**: Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms. 

THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE 
*As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.*

### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
**Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:**
1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

**ACCESSING ELEMENTS**
DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.
 *Sometimes you will just want to access one individual element (or a fragment of the page that is stored within that one element). Other times you may want to select a group of element s, for example, every < h l> element in the page or every <1 i> element within a particular list.*
