# **HTML AND CSS summary:**

### **Tags:** Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

## **Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

### *Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).*

### Every **HTML** element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

### The **< div >** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. For example, you might create a < div > element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a < div > element to contain comments from visitors. In a browser, the contents of the < div > element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page. 

### **HTML5** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

## **Headers & Footers**:
### The <header> and <footer>elements can be used for:
**1.The main header or footerthat appears at the top orbottom of every page on the site.**
**2.A header or footer for an individual < article > or< section > within the page.**

## **Navigation**:
### The < nav > element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.




## **Articles:**
### The < article > element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

## **Aside:**
### The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not. When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.


## **Sections:**
### The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

## **Process & Design:**
### **Site Maps** :
### The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

### **WireFrames:**
#### By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page isincluded. You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.
