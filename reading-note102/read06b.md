# Introducing CSS

### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content ofan element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

### The <body> element creates the first box, then the <h1>, <h2>,<p>, <i>, and <a> elements each create their own boxes within it.Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes,specify its width and height, oradd a background color. You could also control text insidea box — for example, its color,size, and the typeface used


### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules governhow the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
### A CSS rulecontains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

## CSS Properties AffectHow Elements AreDisplayed :

### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.


## CSS Selectors:
### There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you totarget rules to specific elementsin an HTML document. 

## How Css Rules Cascade:
### If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element,it is important to understand which will take precedence.

# Color

### Computer monitors are madeup of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look veryclosely at your monitor you should be able to see them).When the screen is not turnedon, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it'son, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms ofa mix of red, green, and blue —just like on a television screen.


## Hue is the colloquial idea ofcolor. In HSL colors, hue is oftenrepresented as a color circle where the angle represents thecolor, although it may also beshown as a slider with valuesfrom 0 to 360.

## Saturation is the amount ofgray in a color. Saturation isrepresented as a percentage.100% is full saturation and 0%is a shade of gray.

## Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black(darkness) in a color. Lightnessis represented as a percentage.0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightnessis sometimes referred to asluminosity.
